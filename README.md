# Sentiment-Analysis-using-transformers
Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. With transformers, this process has become much more efficient and accurate.

1. Collecting the Dataset
Source Selection:
Choose a source for your comments, such as social media platforms, product reviews, or forums. Publicly available datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository) can also be useful.

Data Collection:
Use web scraping tools (e.g., Beautiful Soup or Scrapy) or APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to gather comments. Make sure to comply with the website's terms of service.

Data Formatting:
Save the collected data in a CSV file format. The file should include at least two columns:

Comment (the text of the comment)
Label (sentiment label: positive, neutral, or negative). The labels can either be manually annotated or sourced from pre-labeled datasets.
2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning:
Remove irrelevant data, special characters, and perform tokenization. This step may also include lowercasing and removing stop words, although transformers handle much of this automatically.

Splitting:
Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A typical split is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

3. Model Selection and Training
Choose a Transformer Model:
Popular transformer models for sentiment analysis include BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. These models are easily accessible through libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers.

i. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Bidirectional Pretraining:
BERT reads the entire sentence at once, which allows it to capture more context than models that read text in a left-to-right or right-to-left manner. BERT is trained using a Masked Language Model (MLM) approach, where some words are randomly masked, and the model is tasked with predicting those words based on context.

Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):
BERT also learns to predict whether one sentence logically follows another, which helps in tasks like question answering and natural language inference.

Pretraining & Fine-tuning Paradigm:

Pretraining: BERT is pretrained on a large corpus (like Wikipedia and BooksCorpus) in an unsupervised manner to learn general language representations.
Fine-tuning: After pretraining, BERT is fine-tuned for specific tasks, like sentiment analysis, by adding task-specific layers and optimizing the model for those tasks.
ii. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)

Larger Pretraining Corpus:
RoBERTa uses a significantly larger dataset for pretraining compared to BERT, including data from Common Crawl (over 160GB).

No Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):
RoBERTa removes the NSP task, which was found not to contribute significantly to performance.

Dynamic Masking:
RoBERTa uses dynamic masking, meaning the words to be masked are randomized in each epoch, allowing for better learning of word representations.

Larger Batch Sizes & More Training Steps:
RoBERTa is trained with larger batch sizes and more iterations to better capture patterns in the data.

iii. DistilBERT (Distilled BERT)

Knowledge Distillation:
DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and more efficient version of BERT. It is created by distilling knowledge from the larger BERT model, where the smaller "student" model learns to approximate the output of the larger "teacher" model.

Smaller Model Size:
DistilBERT reduces the number of parameters by 60% (keeping 6 layers instead of 12) while maintaining 97% of BERT's language understanding capabilities.

Faster Inference:
Due to its smaller size, DistilBERT is faster, making it ideal for real-time applications or systems with limited computational resources.

Preserving Performance:
DistilBERT retains about 95% of BERTâ€™s performance for various downstream tasks despite being more efficient.

4. Model Evaluation
Metrics:
Evaluate your trained model using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set to assess how well it is performing.

Testing:
Once the model achieves satisfactory performance on the validation set, test it on the unseen test set to measure its generalization and real-world performance.

5. Classification of Comments
Inference:
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen comments. The model will output probabilities for each sentiment class (positive, neutral, or negative), allowing you to classify the comments.

Thresholding:
Set a threshold on the predicted probabilities to classify the comments. For example, a probability higher than 0.5 could be classified as positive, while a lower probability could be classified as negative (depending on the setup and the number of classes).
