# Sentiment-Analysis-using-transformers
Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. With transformers, this process has become much more efficient and accurate.

1. Collecting the Dataset

    Source Selection: Choose a source for your comments, such as social media platforms, product reviews, or forums. Publicly available datasets (like those from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository) can also be useful.

    Data Collection: Use web scraping tools (like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy) or APIs (like Twitter API) to gather comments. Ensure you comply with the site's terms of service.

    Data Formatting: Save the collected data in a CSV file format. The file should include at least two columns: comment and label. The label can be manually annotated (positive, neutral, negative) or sourced from pre-labeled datasets.

2. Data Preprocessing

    Cleaning: Remove irrelevant data, special characters, and perform tokenization. This step may also include lowercasing and removing stop words, although transformers often handle this well.

    Splitting: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 80/10/10 split).

3. Model Selection and Training

    Choose a Transformer Model: Popular choices include BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, all of which can be easily accessed through libraries like Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers.

    Fine-tuning: Load a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on your dataset. This can be done using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, with a focus on adapting the model for your specific sentiment classification task.

4. Model Evaluation

    Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set.

    Testing: Once satisfied with performance, test the model on the unseen test set to measure real-world performance.

5. Classification of Comments

    Inference: Use the trained model to predict sentiments on new comments. The model will output probabilities for each class (positive, neutral, negative), allowing you to classify the comments.
   
    Thresholding: Set a threshold to classify comments based on the predicted probabilities, ensuring you accurately categorize sentiments.
